# SS2 Rickenbacker Instant-Death Remover
A simple mini-mod to prevent the forcefield jump in the Rickenbacker from being instant death. Instead, you can now climb out of the pit and try again.

Packaged releases are usually posted on the forum thread. This repo exists as a backup, and as somewhere for anyone interested to grab my source files.

## Info for Modders

This mod was made using [makedml](https://github.com/tunbridgep/ss2-makedml). This means the DML files are split into multiple different files.

All it does is add headers. You don't need it if you want to make a modification. Instead, just download the source, and add headers manually (headers can be found [here](https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=6821.0))
